    "summary": "Andy describes the practical mechanics of recruiting non-network customers for customer development interviews: use a small financial incentive (e.g., $100 Amazon gift card) targeted specifically at people who match the ideal customer profile. Even with this approach, expect only 40-50% show rates, so book 10-15 sessions to reliably get 5 conversations per week.",
    "quote": "We would focus on somebody who wasn't in our network, but whose characteristics fit our ideal customer profile. And even by doing that... we'd still only get about 40 or 50% of them that would show up.",
    "decision": "Used $100 Amazon gift cards targeted at ICP-matched non-network prospects to recruit customer development interview participants.",
    "outcome": "Achieved roughly 40-50% show rates, requiring booking 10-15 sessions to reliably complete 5 customer interviews per week.",
    "lesson": "Customer development recruiting outside your network requires financial incentive plus ICP filtering and should be planned with a 2x booking buffer to account for no-shows.",

A key element is that the case study is intentionally too complex to fully solve upfront, so interviewers can observe how candidates react to new assumptions and changing information in real time.",
    "quote": "An important part of the case study is that it's actually too complex for people to have all of the answers up front. It's just like the space of the problem is too large to do that, which means that in the interview, there's a lot of opportunities to just ask ad hoc questions or to change one assumption. And seeing how people react to that is really indicative of how deeply they understand a new problem.",
